### Advanced Mortgage Scenario

**User**: "Compare mortgage payments for a $600,000 house with 10% down vs. 20% down, with a 15-year vs. 30-year loan term, at current interest rates."

**Claude** will use the `calculate_mortgage` tool multiple times to create a comparison:

```python
scenario1 = calculate_mortgage(home_price=600000, down_payment_percent=10, loan_term=30, interest_rate=6.5)
scenario2 = calculate_mortgage(home_price=600000, down_payment_percent=20, loan_term=30, interest_rate=6.5)
scenario3 = calculate_mortgage(home_price=600000, down_payment_percent=10, loan_term=15, interest_rate=6.0)
scenario4 = calculate_mortgage(home_price=600000, down_payment_percent=20, loan_term=15, interest_rate=6.0)
```

**Response**:
```
Comparison of Mortgage Scenarios for a $600,000 home:

Scenario 1: 10% Down, 30-Year Term (6.5%)
- Down Payment: $60,000
- Monthly Payment: $4,230.67 (includes PMI)
- Total Interest: $699,531.06
- Total Cost: $1,521,952.81

Scenario 2: 20% Down, 30-Year Term (6.5%)
- Down Payment: $120,000
- Monthly Payment: $3,758.92 (no PMI)
- Total Interest: $612,212.52
- Total Cost: $1,473,213.38

Scenario 3: 10% Down, 15-Year Term (6.0%)
- Down Payment: $60,000
- Monthly Payment: $5,279.38 (includes PMI)
- Total Interest: $352,587.29
- Total Cost: $1,110,291.59

Scenario 4: 20% Down, 15-Year Term (6.0%)
- Down Payment: $120,000
- Monthly Payment: $4,641.48 (no PMI)
- Total Interest: $315,466.92
- Total Cost: $1,035,466.92

Analysis:
The 15-year term saves significantly on interest but requires higher monthly payments. The 20% down payment scenarios avoid PMI and reduce total interest paid. The most cost-effective option is Scenario 4 (20% down, 15-year term), while Scenario 2 (20% down, 30-year term) offers the lowest monthly payment while still avoiding PMI.

## Multi-Step Analysis Examples

### Home Buying Decision Support

**User**: "I'm relocating to Denver with a budget of $500,000-$700,000 for a 4-bedroom house. I need good schools and a reasonable commute to downtown. What neighborhoods should I consider, what can I expect to find, and what would my monthly costs look like?"

**Claude** would use multiple tools to provide a comprehensive analysis:

1. First, search for properties in Denver:
```python
properties = search_properties(
    location="Denver, CO",
    type="forSale",
    min_price=500000,
    max_price=700000,
    beds_min=4
)
```

2. Analyze market trends:
```python
trends = get_market_trends(location="Denver, CO")
```

3. Calculate mortgage scenarios:
```python
mortgage = calculate_mortgage(
    home_price=600000,  # Midpoint of budget
    down_payment_percent=20,
    interest_rate=6.5
)
```

4. Combine the information to provide a detailed recommendation that covers neighborhoods, property types, school ratings, commute considerations, and financial projections.
